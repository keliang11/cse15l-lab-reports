Hi! This tutorial is for future CSE 15L students about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.

First go to https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php and log in using your username and PID. Then, click on the account that starts with cs15lwi23.

Then click on the link to change your password. It will take you to a page where you type in your current password and your new password. Choose "no" for the changing TritonLink password and "yes" for changing course-specific account password. Then, press **enter** instead of clicking "check password".

If your password change was successful, you should see the following page below.(SEE BELOW)

Next, install VSCode. I already had this instealled previously, but it is pretty straightforward. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and follow the instructions.

After successfully installing, you should be able to open a window like the one below.(SEE BELOW)

Next, open the terminal in VSCode. Open the command pallete, type **select default profile**. Select git bash, then click the plus sign to open a new bask terminal.
